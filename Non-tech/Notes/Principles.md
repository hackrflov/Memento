5 principles of Ray Dalio
-------------------------
1. Working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do;
2. Coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals;
3. Stress-testing my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong;
4. Being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing;
5. Wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.

## Most fundamental principle
**Truth**  
--more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality--  
is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.

### I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.

### I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity's most pervasive driving force.

### I believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded.

### How much people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted.

### The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things (strengths and weaknesses)

### We aren't born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it.

### It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one's limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength-whether it's in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way.

Your Most Important Choices
---------------------------
1. Pain + Reflection = Progress
2. Ask yourself, "Is it true?"
3. Worry about achieving the goal rather than appearing good
4. Make decisions on the basis of first-, second-, and third-order consequences
5. Hold yourself accountable

### Two yous. The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objetively.

### Goals are the things you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent you from reaching your goals. Desires are typically first-order consequences.

### The more painful the problem, the louder it is screaming. In order to be successful, you have to 1) perceive problems and 2) not tolerate them.
