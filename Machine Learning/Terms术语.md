+ generalization error: out-of-sample error  
+ online learning: process input piece-by-piece without having the entire input from the start  
+ ensemble learning: use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance  
+ bagging: Bootstrap aggregating, which generates m new training sets by sampling from D uniformly and with replacement  
+ mode: the most common value among a group
