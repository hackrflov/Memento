## Goals
- Presentation
- Exploration
- Confirmation

## Data Reduction 
- Filtering: Eliminate some items or attributes
- Aggregation: Represent a group of elements by a new derived element  
[Never use 3D plot, use visual attribute instead]

## Type of Chart 
+ Comparisons
    - Bar Chart: For showing categorical data.
    - Line Chart: For extrapolating numerical data(both x and y axises). [Use log scale instead of linear scale to magnify changes]
    - Stacked Bar Chart: Good for observing overall trends.
    - Layered Bar Chart
    - Grouped Bar Chart
    - Stacked Area Chart: Use for showing quantitative data that changes over time
+ Correlations
    - Scatterplots: Use alpha value to avoid overplotting.
+ Compositions
    - Pie Charts: Use it only when proportion is highly focused(In other situation we use bar charts).
+ Distribution
    - Histogram: Choose suitable bins.
    - Density Plots: Smooth curve established upon histogram.
    - Heat Maps: 2d chart with distinct clusters.
    - Box Plots: Use **median** and interquartile range as box and 1.5 x IQR as whisker per side.
    - Violin Plot: A box plot plus the probability density.

## Terms 
- *How to chosse aspect ratios?* Banking to 45 degrees(the curve maximized to 45).

## Two features
- Expressive: showing the data and just the data
- Effective: enable the user to perform the task

## Visual Variables
- Points
- Lines
- Areas
- Position
- Shape
- Size
- Color: bad for quantitative data (use brightness or diverging color instead) [Color Brewer]
- Tilt
- Volume

## Grouping Principles
- Containment
- Connection
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Continuity
- Common Fate

## Visulization Principles
- Alaways start your bar from zero. Scales are critical!
- Pie chart should always add up to 100.
- Size of the graphic effect should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities.
- 3D plot is bad as it will cause distortion.
- Maximize data-ink ratio.
- Avoid chart junk.
