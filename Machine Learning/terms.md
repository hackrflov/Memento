+ generalization error: out-of-sample error  
+ online learning: process input piece-by-piece without having the entire input from the start  
+ ensemble learning: use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance  
+ bagging: Bootstrap aggregating, which generates m new training sets by sampling from D uniformly and with replacement  
+ mode: the most common value among a group  
+ nominal: described as something and cannot be calculated, similar to categorical
+ ordinal: number which has order and can be sorted, but we cannot perform arithmetic on it
+ quantiative: number which we can perform math operations on it (add, minus, etc)
+ random variable: independent
+ variance: square of standard deviation
+ standard error: describe variance of different samples
+ central limit theorem
